# Print XBlock
Adds a simple print button. Note that this does nothing more than pressing CTRL+P would, it's purely intended for less tech-savvy students. If you want your site to actually look good in the printout, you'll need a theme that displays properly when printed.

Short name for enabling - "print-xblock"
